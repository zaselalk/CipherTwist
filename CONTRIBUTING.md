## Coding Standards

### Java Coding Conventions

- Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs)
- Class names should be in **PascalCase** (e.g., `CipherTwist`)
- Method and variable names should be in **camelCase** (e.g., `encryptText`)
- Constants should be in **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** (e.g., `MAX_KEY_LENGTH`)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Add JavaDoc comments for public methods and classes

### Example:

```java
/**
 * Encrypts the given text using the CipherTwist algorithm.
 * 
 * @param text The plaintext to encrypt
 * @param key The encryption key (integer)
 * @return The encrypted text in binary format
 */
public static String encrypt(String text, int key) {
    // Implementation
}
```
